# Employee Technical Skills Training
Summer 2019 Internship Presentation
By: Myca Bautista 

This final presentation showcases the projects I did and learn from the internship. I wanted to document it through what I know best, development. I did a lot of work on documentation and training manuals. I incorporated how the ADA (American with Disabilities Act) compliance plays a big role in user experience. That includes putting alt-texts on images and researching on how to make documents accessible. I even learned what technologies employees used in the education field.
