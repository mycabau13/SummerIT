# Employee Technical Skills Training
Summer 2019 Internship Presentation
By: Myca Bautista 

This final presentation documents what projects I did and learn for the internship. I wanted to document it through what I know best, development. I did a lot of work on documentation and how the ADA (American with Disabilities Act) compliance plays a big role in design. I even learned what technologies employees used in the education field.
